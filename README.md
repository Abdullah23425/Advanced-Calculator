🧮 Advanced Calculator – Java Swing GUI
📌 Overview
This project is a Multi-Mode Advanced Calculator built using Java Swing. It features a clean, interactive GUI interface with multiple operational modes suited for everyday use, scientific calculations, and programming-related computations. It also includes a history tracker and settings customization.

The goal is to provide a user-friendly, extendable, and functional calculator with the feel of a physical scientific calculator and the flexibility of a digital tool.

🎯 Features
🔀 Multi-Mode System

The calculator provides several distinct operational modes accessible from a side menu:

Main Mode: Basic arithmetic operations.

Functional Mode: Includes advanced functions like trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions.

Programmer Mode: Binary, hexadecimal conversions and bitwise operations.

History: Shows previous calculations performed during the session.

🔣 Scientific & Functional Operations

The Functional Mode adds advanced operations:

sin, cos, tan, cot

√ (square root), ∛ (cube root), n√x (nth root)

x^y, e^x, 10^x

log (base 10), ln (natural logarithm)

π, e, ! (factorial)

1/x, |x| (absolute value), x², ½, %

🧠 Memory & History Support

Memory Buttons:

M+: Add current value to memory.

M-: Subtract current value from memory.

MR: Recall memory.

MC: Clear memory.

History:

The settings menu (⚙️) allows the user to:

Toggle dark/light mode (future expansion).

Change angle unit (degrees/radians).

Set themes or font sizes.

Enable/disable sound or click feedback (optional).

🖼️ GUI Breakdown
The GUI consists of:

Side Menu Panel:

Navigation between modes.

Settings access.

Display Panel:

Dual-line text field: input & output.

Button Grid:

Organized by color and category:

Orange: Actions like DEL, AC, arithmetic.

Blue: Functional/scientific operations.

Grey: Numeric pad (0–9).

Dark: Mode/logic-related toggles.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Java (JDK 17+)

Java Swing

NetBeans GUI Builder (Matisse) – for WYSIWYG interface design.
